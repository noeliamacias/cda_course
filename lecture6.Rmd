Load data from Matloff example
```{r}
mlb <- read.table('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matloff/fasteR/master/data/mlb.txt',header=TRUE)

mlb
```

Save and load
```{r}
library(writexl)
library(readxl)
mlb %>% write_xlsx("MLB.xlsx")
mlb1 <- read_xlsx("MLB.xlsx") 
```

EDA
```{r}
mlb <- mlb %>% mutate(Height = Height*2.54, Weight = Weight*0.45359237)
mlb
```

Distribution of height
```{r}
boxplot(mlb$Height)
```
```{r}
mlb$Height %>% summary
```

Distribution of weight
```{r}
boxplot(mlb$Weight)
```

```{r}
mlb$Weight %>% summary
```

Who has the larget weight
```{r}
mlb %>% filter(Weight > 120)
```

```{r}
plot(x = mlb$Height, y = mlb$Weight, col = mlb$Position)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight, colour = Team), data = mlb) + geom_point()
```

```{r}
plot(x = mlb$Height, y = mlb$Weight)
```

Weight vs Age

```{r}
plot(x = mlb$Age, y = mlb$Weight)
```

```{r}
out <- lm(Weight~Age, data = mlb)
summary(out)
```

```{r}
plot(x = mlb$Age, y = mlb$Weight)
abline(out, col = 2)
```

```{r}
summary(out)
```


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Weight), data = mlb) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Weight), data = mlb) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + facet_wrap(~Position)
```

```{r}
out <- lm(Weight~Age+Height, data = mlb)
summary(out)
```

```{r}
plot(residuals(out))
```
